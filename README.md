# CS1430-Final

## Description

This is a project which applies filters to faces in real time using a webcam. The project can apply a filter to multiple faces at once, and will retain the resolution of the filter. Filters are clean square images which sit cleanly on a face, with the nose in the middle, and have absolute black (pixel value 0) where the face is meant to show through the filter.

## How To Run

Please run with "python main.py -f multi" or "-f plant" or "-f std" to apply one of our three filters to your face.
